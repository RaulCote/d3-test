# D3 Test

Donut Chart Graphics using D3. I didn't know anything about D3 so i had to study before, the data is connected to a mockup database made with Postman.

I didn't have the time to implement Jasmine, i worked with it some times but the tests were already written. I know almost everything works with 'it' and 'describe'. I shouldn't have difficulties to put it into practice but i was short on time. 

There's no mobile version, only Desktop. 

To run the app clone it, and run index.html. Take in mind the mockup has a limit usage.
